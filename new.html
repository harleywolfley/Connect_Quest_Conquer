                <h3>Meeting New People</h3>
                <p>Making new friends expands our world and helps us form new connections. It can be hard to know where to start,
                    but there are some good tips to keep in mind! First, don't be afraid to approach someone new. You can
                    compliment their outfit, or mention a shared interest. Don't be afraid to ask them questions--people
                    will usually be happy to talk about themselves.</p>

                <h3>Listen to Others</h3>
                <p>An important aspect of talking to others is listening. If you only talk about yourself, or don't pay attention
                    to peoples' answers, they'll be less likely to feel appreciated. Active listening helps with this. Keep 
                    eye contact with the person you're talking to, and take a confident stance.</p>

                <h3>Seek Out Opportunities</h3>
                <p>You have to take the first step in reaching out. Initiate conversation and share openly, to encourage others 
                    to do the same. In addition, keep looking for chances to connect with those around you. They can happen in 
                    places you might not expect, like a grocery store or a classroom.</p>
