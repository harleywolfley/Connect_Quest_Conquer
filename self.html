                <h3>Failure and Forgiveness</h3>
                <p>Sometimes life throws trials in your path. In these times, it's important to remember that your trials do not define you, but your actions that do. Practice grace and forgiveness as well as strength and courage to yourself to help you through your trials.</p>

                <h3>Communicate With Yourself</h3>
                <p>Keep yourself up to date by talking it out. This can be out loud or a peaceful moment in your head. This opportunity can help you realize the depth and importance of what you choose and do. Then, you can do what you want! Being able to communicate with yourself helps you connect with your feelings. Feelings lead to memories and experiences. They help you learn what you want!</p>
