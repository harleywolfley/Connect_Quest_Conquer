                <h3>Stay Calm, Stay Clear</h3>
                <p>The first step in resolving any conflict is regulating your own emotions. When you stay calm, you
                    think more clearly, communicate more respectfully, and avoid saying things you’ll regret later. Take
                    a breath, slow down, and focus on understanding the problem before reacting to it. Clarity and
                    composure often prevent small disagreements from becoming big ones.</p>

                <h3>Listen to Understand, Not to Win</h3>
                <p>Most conflicts escalate not because people disagree, but because they feel unheard. Active
                    listening—making eye contact, not interrupting, repeating back what you heard—helps the other person
                    feel respected and lowers defensiveness. When you listen with the goal of understanding rather than
                    arguing, solutions appear much faster and both sides feel more willing to compromise.</p>

            <section class="two">
                <h3>Solve the Problem, Not the Person</h3>
                <p>Focus your energy on fixing the issue rather than blaming the other person. Shift from statements
                    like “You always…” to “The issue is…” This keeps the conversation constructive and
                    solution-oriented. When both sides view each other as partners instead of opponents, it becomes
                    easier to brainstorm options, negotiate, and reach an agreement that feels fair to everyone.</p>
